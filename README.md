An algorithm which produces all solutions to a given Challenge 24 puzzle using recursion and backtracking. The algorithm is able to solve puzzles for a general 
N and set of operands, not just the standard N = 24 with 4 operands. To run the program, simply run challenge24.py, input a number N, and input a set of operands
a1, a2, a3, ... ak. The program will find every way to combine a1, a2, a3, ... ak to produce N via standard arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), print each one,
and print the total count once the process is terminated.
